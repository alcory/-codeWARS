# CODEWARS KATA's
This repository contains my solutions to the presented CODEWARS problems, or KATA as they put it, all of them written in PYTHON.

My profile in the webpage is https://www.codewars.com/users/alcory


Next, you will find an explanation to every document published in this repository


## Convert number to reversed array of digits
Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.

Example(Input => Output):
35231 => [1,3,2,5,3]
0 => [0]


## Replace with alphabet position
In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

"a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

Example
alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
Should return "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" ( as a string )


## Stop gninnipS My sdroW!
Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

Examples:
spinWords( "Hey fellow warriors" ) => returns "Hey wollef sroirraw" 
spinWords( "This is a test") => returns "This is a test" 
spinWords( "This is another test" )=> returns "This is rehtona test"


## Sum of Digits / Digital Root
Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

Examples
    16  -->  1 + 6 = 7
   942  -->  9 + 4 + 2 = 15  -->  1 + 5 = 6
132189  -->  1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 24  -->  2 + 4 = 6
493193  -->  4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 29  -->  2 + 9 = 11  -->  1 + 1 = 2


## Split Strings
Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').

Examples:
* 'abc' =>  ['ab', 'c_']
* 'abcdef' => ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']


## Who likes it?
You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

[]                                -->  "no one likes this"
["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
Note: For 4 or more names, the number in "and 2 others" simply increases.


## Disemvowel Trolls
Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.


## Roman numbers decoder
Create a function that takes a Roman numeral as its argument and returns its value as a numeric decimal integer. You don't need to validate the form of the Roman numeral.

Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each decimal digit of the number to be encoded separately, starting with the leftmost digit and skipping any 0s. So 1990 is rendered "MCMXC" (1000 = M, 900 = CM, 90 = XC) and 2008 is rendered "MMVIII" (2000 = MM, 8 = VIII). The Roman numeral for 1666, "MDCLXVI", uses each letter in descending order.

Example:
solution('XXI') # should return 21


## Moving Zeros To The End
Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

move_zeros([1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3]) # returns [1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0]
